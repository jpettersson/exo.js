Overview
--------

Extensions for [Spine.js](http://spinejs.com/)

I'm developing these extensions for a couple of Spine.js based projects I'm working on. <br />
The idea is to eventually clean them up, slap on some docs and release them as a useful library.

Exo.StateMachine
----------------
A small implementation of a finite state machine.

Exo.Node
--------


Exo.Spine.Controller
--------------------
This class extends the Spine.Controller and infuses it will all the functionality of the Exo.Node

Tests
-----

* Using Jasmine
* Specs written in Coffeescript
* Run with catapult
