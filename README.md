exo.js
======

This project is abanoned and will not receive any further updates. I've switched to angular.js and find that angular + angular-animate covers my use cases so far.

Introduction
------------

Exo is a library and work-flow for creating heavily animated and realtime JS GUI's. Exo takes care of the state management between different components in a UI.
